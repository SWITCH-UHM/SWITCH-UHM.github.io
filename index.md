SWITCH is a student led organization with the purpose of promoting racial and gender equality in the Information and Computer Science Department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 

## Importance
In the Spring of 2019, the Title IX office at UH Manoa offered training to ICSpace in response to a Campus Climate survey. It is notable that ICSpace is a study area designated for students, meaning that it is highly probable that student interactions in ICSpace are what prompted the survey response. For that reason, it is crucial that there be changes in the student atmosphere in the department and those changes have to come from the students themsevles. SWITCH will serve as a platform for a student community that supports members of all races, genders and sexual orientations. 

## Where We Are Now
SWITCH is in the process of becoming an official RIO regocnized by the University of Hawaii at Manoa for the Fall 2019 Semester. SWITCH currently has a subgroup, [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/), dedicated to promoting the female programming experience.

## SWITCH Plans For the Future
After becoming a RIO, SWITCH will then apply to become an chapter of [ACM-W](https://women.acm.org/)
We plan to do educational outreach to public elementary, middle or high schools. In the future, we will arrange for professional talks from under represented programmers. 

Our most ambitious goal is to create a feeder system from the community colleges within the UH system to UH Manoa through membership with SWITCH, where each community college could have their own campus specific SWITCH liason. Said liason could even start a campus specifc SWITCH subgroup if there were enough interested students, or SWITCH could merge with existing Computer Science groups on those campuses. 

We believe that by creating a sense of community for marginalized individuals will help to prevent a hostile environment in the future, as well as promote retention among members of underrepresented groups.
