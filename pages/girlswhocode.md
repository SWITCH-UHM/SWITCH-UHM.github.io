### About College Loops
<img src="/assets/docs/gwc-logo.png">

Girls Who Code is so excited to have you. Over the last 7 years, we have taught computer science to nearly 185,000 middle and high school girls in all 50 states and across the globe. This fall, nearly 30,000 Girls Who Code alumni are enrolled in college, many of whom are in this program! We want to continue supporting women on their journey in computing. As we are all aware, the field of computer science and technology is extremely male dominated, and classroom demographics can also reflect that. We hope that your College Loop will counter that feeling and continue to support you by creating a community of women who are using their passions for problem- solving, social change, and computing to work towards their unique goals. Whether you participated in a Girls Who Code program in the past or are a woman new to GWC and interested in CS - we’re so excited to welcome you to the Girls Who Code network.


<strong>Plus, as a member of Girls Who Code College Loops, you’ll have access to nearly 100 corporate companies, regional events, other Girls Who Code participants, and more. Each challenge completed is a chance for your group to receive prizes and giveaways.</strong>

### More Than Code

What makes Girls Who Code special is that we're not just here to teach you how to code. We believe that in order to change the world you need more than just your coding skills. So, along with building strong ties and developing a supportive network of peers, we want you to see yourselves as: Leaders, Allies, and Learners.
