SWITCH is the culmination of efforts of the awesome students, faculty, and working professionals supporting social change in the ICS department. Established in Fall 2019, we are officially a UH Manoa RIO, ACM-W Chapter, and Girls Who Code College Loops Chapter. We strive to provide useful resources from these organizations to improve your professional, technical, and personal development.

### Mission & Values

<blockquote>To support women and minorities, promote gender and racial equality, facilitate professional, technical & personal development events, create an environment and atmosphere where women can feel safe, prevent violence against women by raising awareness of campus resources, and provide an overall sense of community.</blockquote>
